====================== Start checking the calculated CH4 from ISAM. ====================

The imbalance issue is needed to be fixed asap.
Now we first summarize what we have done in the ISAM CH4 module:

!---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now first let's check carefully about the diffusion scheme.

(Suggestion? We can compare against the hydrology treatment if possible?)
One interesting question I have not checked yet is, can diffsion equation conserve the mass?
Oh, yes. Diffusion equation is derived from Fick's law + continuity equation. So we have no reason
to doubt the mass conservation of the equation. I already checked this and probably forgot it...

Now let's check step by step, first to look if diffusion code itself create large imbalance?
Seems like the difference is not small... 

Another issue is that if the DZ_cal we used contained the weight from the fraction of air filled porosity?
I see. We have not considered the effect of air filled porosity. So what shall be the correct way to represent this?
Let's first check from the LPJ_Whyme implementation?

I saw the relative error in a scale of e-4 cannot be avoided using currently our scheme. But why LPJ-Whyme only has a relative error at the scale of e-6?
Check the balance by copying the code outside the module?

I see we have a good diffusion calculation scheme since I tested outside ISAM the corresponding portion of the code. But the imbalance is large after putting the code part into ISAM. What caused this issue?
I did not see any differences or improvements after changing the dt and D for both good case (the case with mass conservation) and bad case (ISAM). Hence there must have other stuff causing this serious issue.
Should we check the tri-diagonal code? Let's go and have a look! Okay, they are the same.
What could be the problem right now? shall we close all the other part of the calculation?
Possible guess is the fluctuation of the gas concentration in the second level. Because the dz in the shallow layers are so small and the reaction to diffusion flux ratio is large, hence a separated calculation of gas consumption without considering as a source/sink to the diffusion scheme can cause issues.
Since we're only examing the diffusion calculation right now, we shall try comment out all O2 consumptions outside the diffusion scheme and check the balance right now!
Okay, I see the issue is still about the treatment of the dissolution process. Before we can add the reaction source/sink terms, we shall think about a way to make this up. How we can include the ch4 fluxes and dissolution into the diffusion scheme?
It seems like we also need to force the first layer being a constant that may maintain the mass conservation.

Done the checking of the diffusion scheme for case 1. How about the case 2 (I expect this to be even easier than case 1)?

I reviewed the CH4 module from CLM. Seems like CLM code considered the diffusion and the balanced dissolution between unsaturated and saturated layer. But it may not be true if we ignore the ch4 concentration inside the water in unsaturated zone. I assume the methanotroph consume oxygen from the aqueous form instead of directly consuming the gaseous CH4. In addtion, there has several differences between CLM and the current diffusion scheme we're using.
1) Considered the depth weighted diffusion rate. I shall carefully check if this will matter the mass conservation of the diffusion scheme.
2) No special treatment of the 2 times the concentation on both sides of the equation for the bottom layer. [But seems like this will not affect too much since the bottom layer seldom has large methane content.]
3) source/sinks terms are included in the RHS of the equation.
4) Seems like the oxygen and methane are treated differently. I shall examine if the diffusion calculation is different in the two cases.
Did not find other differences right now. Need to check once tested the CLM scheme.
I shall copy the code and test it separately.

Okay, I have tested the CLM CH4 module and find out the diffusion scheme in all three models have quite similar behavior thus no extra effort is required to debugging the diffusion scheme any more.
One modification I have to make is to revise the depth weighted diffusive rate, which is important for the integrity of the ISAM methane. 
Any need to adjust the violence of gas mass conservation in the diffusion scheme?
Also, the CH4 and O2 outfluxes calculated by the methane model is too small comparing to the actual imbalance amount. Any idea about how to fix this? Would be good to carefully check how CLm treat this violence.

So right now the first thing we shall do is to resolve the issue related to the dissolution calculation and how to get rid of its impact to mass imbalance.
The second one is to adjust the depth weighted diffusion calculation.

Seems like including dissolution scheme helped the balance checking a lot.
So next we shall check the case 3 that contains the water table in the middle of soil layers.

okay, the case 3 also seems good to me.
Next steps:
1) Should revise the actual diffusive rate to the depth weighted diffusive rate. [Done]
2) we shall consider each sources/sinks terms from calculated from the model. [Done]
3) Need to debug the calculation of the trace gas flux across the atm-soil interface. 

Done the step 1)

After checking the source/sink term, I found the error to be related to the diffusion scheme that create large difference from the previous calculated value.
I found the issue to be related to the abnormal source/sink term. Things are becoming clear.
The abnormal sources/sinks are fixed. The issue is from the too tiny number of the air fraction.

Seems like the WT calculation is not for every step? Need to check the code.
It seems like the WT calculation is fine. Need not to adjust this.

So let's move forward to check the source/sink calculation and the mass conservation in the diffusion scheme now.
Source/sink term has been revised. Now need to check if the term is consistent with the term outside? Checked. It is fine.
But a question is why the output showing the source/sink term alway be positive (source)? It is not correct for dry soil to have big source. Need to see why...
Okay, the only source of CH4 is the methanogenesis. Have we overwstimated it?
Yeah, it seems like we have some overestimation of methanogenesis. We shall return to check this later.
Another more important error we shall fix is the CH4 mass conservation after the diffusion calculation.
It seems to be a tough one... I have no clue why this error could happen. Probably the separated treatment on water table soil layer causing this mass conservation failure?
Let's first check case 1 and case 2.
This issue is more complicated than I thought...
What component has caused this error? It makes no sense even after I divide source/sink terms by dis_factor. Could this be the issue about the mis-calculated diffusive flux?
Highly possible.
I believe the way calcuilating the surface flux is not correct. The error shall be included as a protion of the diffusion flux then. But first thing is to make sure the inside column is mass conserved.
I have revised the code to adjust the mass balance by adding the error term into diffusion flux. It makes sense that error term shall be considered as diffusive flux.

Okay, now the next step is going to check the error from every CH4 terms in the wetland methane module.
1) I found the dry land has erroneous wetland methane emission due to extremely high arenchyma transportation. Need to check this term out for dryland... []
2) Another option is to see if CLM has produced reasonable estimation?
3) Once after removing the arenchyma transportation, we shall really focus on the soil oxidation. Need to check if the global and/or CONUS soil oxidation estimated from our model is going to be a correct number comparing to other published studies?
4) Need to add the arenchyma transporation of oxygen.

After testing on a global scale, we found more issues related in some points. Need to fix these bugs as well.
Okay. seems like the dissolution factor can be very sensitivie even to the order of 1e-10.

One more bug has been figured out when performing global simulation. We now need to check the wrong ebullition term that causing erroneous methane efflux.
Now we may need to find a historical atmospheric methane curve and the projected atmospheric methane curve under different projections, at least for RCP8.5.
Also, about how to design the experiments to calculate the global methane emission, any idea? [Carbon profile stabilized in the spinup. Also prevent to include any arenchyma transportation of CH4 for the non-wetland soils. Need to pay large attention to this point.

Strangely, I found another bug related to the initilizing the water table depth. Check if water table has been read in correctly and if the initilization of naerobic, nanaerobic and nwt are correct.
Could be an issue related to the perched water table? Yes, it is.
So we need to add perhced water table into the initial file.

Fixed another bug related to the methane exchange between water table and the air above.

After getting the results of the global simulation, I found the following issues:
1) The water table depth for eastern Siberia is not simulated correctly, hence we do not have enough methane emission from that region.
2) The model accumulated too high the soil organic carbon in the tropics. For given the water table depth to be correct comparing to other study, this may be caused by a too fast downward transportation of SOC. However the bioturbation can be highly limited in that region.
3) CH4 from the pan-arctic wetland is relatively low. This is erroneous comparing to other studies so we need to focus and fix this issue also.

In summary, few issues can be diagnosed:
1) Water table depth. Cannot be resolved by combining the topographic effect with varaible soil layers. We have to think about another approach. Maybe the topographic impact is too small? (Anyway, even we cannot capture the water table 100% correct, we may get reasonable wetland methane emission since we prescibed the wetland area.) 
[Let's hold this issue till later.]

[X] 2) Stop the aerenchyma transportation for non-wetland region
Easy to finish. Shall address later.

[X] 3) Ebullition is required to be examined again.
Checked. The equations are correct following Wania et al., 2010. But the calculated C_max is too high (~2000mmol m-3). Since the CH4 concentration calculated from LPJ_Whyme is too high (> 5000mmol m-3), it seems okay to produce such a high amount of methane through ebullition. But based on Elberling et al., 2011, we can only find a saturatedCH4 concentration up to 200 mmol m-3 soil, around 800mmol m-3 water if VWC=0.25. And the ebullition will happen mostly around 500mmol m-3 (Walter et al., 1996). So I applied here a 0.25 scale factor to adjust the original V_max calculation to get the C_max near 500 mmol m-3. Further investigation is needed but right now let's just remediate the C_max through this rudimentary way. 

[X] 4) Methane production is small in the arctic. Need to think about the reason?
See the response of issue #7.

[X] 5) Diffusive rate and plant root C input need to be modified!
This one is right now the first priority! [We have site for checking the C14 profile!]
Also, we have found too high carbon stock for evergreen forests in tropics.
Now I mediated this issue by revising the rooting depth of the tropical forest. But still need more effort to constrain other physical states such as NPP, litter turnover and soil turnover. Can be the work for the next step (I suppose I shall not get involved into this calibration trouble again but seems like I have to mediate some processes). 

[X] 6) Need to check if the methane fluxes from wetland has been added up to the bgc output?
Shall be easy to finish. 
I have checked and made sure the fluxes are accounted in the output.

7) Soil resistance for gas diffusion by snow coverage is required.
Shall take care of this later. Directly copy from CESM?

[X] 8) Shall double check if the water table depth for wetland and inudated land has been applied correctly?
This has been validated.

[X] 9) A global test simulation shows a high root litter from grass? Need to check if the vertical transportation is too high or the rooting depth is too high.
Too deep the rooting depth. So we here revised the parameters controling the rooting depth. This issue must be addressed in the SBGC paper properly.
Also, we seems to underestimate the litterfall of the northern tundra and boreal forest. Shall check if the moss insulation we added has caused this issue?
It will be helpful to review some previous studies about the control factors between rooting depth and root biomass. Such as plant species, soil temperature, soil moisture and nutrients. This can be the work for the next step.
Okay, I fixed the overestimated rooting depth for several different biomes.

========================= Apply ISAM model for preparing the AGU talk =======================
I have done the first draft of the AGU slides. Next step shall be examining why we have a drastic decrease of the CH4 emission after changing the climate forcing from CRUNCEP to RCP scenarios. Something strange happened after switching the climate forcings.

[X] 1) I believe I need to summarize all the parameters and their origin that being used in our methane model. In the meantime I shall be able to writing the model description of the methane module.
Done

2) Also, the next table should include the description of the sites being used by ISAM for model calibration or evaluation. A good strategy would be calibrating the model using 1 site in each category: upland arctic, lowland arctic, upland temeprate/tropics, lowland temperate/tropics, and evaluate the model using other sites remaining. If the site level data are not so enough, we shall think about applying the model to answer another more interesting question but not just a paper for model description only.

[X] 3) I have found the model fail to calculate the soil methane oxidation correctly. Need to check the parameterization.
Okay, I have now revised the key parameters.

4) The diffusion of trace gas across the snow is needed.
Has not added yet. May add soon. This is a similar issue as issue 7a)

[X] 5) O2 transport through aerenchyma is required.
Seems like I have already considered this? But the amount seems not correct. See if there has some issues?
Need to check for wetland site. The upland may only have tiny amount of the impact.

6) Is methane oxidation near the rhizosphere being required? Probably we shall get back to this point later.

[X] 7) Need to investigate the wetland methane emission in the arctic. There has some issues related to water table and SBGC seems like.
Seems like functions are working fine except too small production of the methane in the arctic lowland region. For given the reasonable respiration (also need to check against available data), I doubt the oxygen limitation is acting as a factor limiting the methane production since the underestimation of oxygen limitation would favor more SOM being decomposed to CO2 thus less labile SOM can support the methane production. 

7a) Also I noticed that we have overestimated the methane diffusion. Though the actual amount of the diffusion is still under debate, but previous papers mentioned a controbution of methane emission from diffusion only about 10%. So more works need to be done preventing more methane emission through diffusion, thus ebullition and aerenchyma transportation could be enhanced.

8) Methanogenesis in the saturated soil microsite is probably needed? Let's evaluate this later.

[X] 9) How shall we go for the future projection of the inundated area?
Shall use the precipitation data as a proxy for extropolating the inundated area.
We applied a logistic equation to project the future inundated area via comparing with precipitation future projection from CESM simulation. 

10) Two types of different methanotrophs need to be separated. One is the methanotroph residing in the rhizosphere, another is the methanitroph residing in the soil. Need to check this later?


========================= Apply ISAM model for preparing the IALE talk =======================
(1) First step is to evaluate the model globally. We selected several sites from Ameriflux and European fluxes database cluster for model testing.
So we want to have a quick look first to see if the annual CH4 matches what we get from the sites we collected.
The second step is to test on the single site level. Evaluate the met data and corresponding fluxes collected from Ameriflux/Euroflux sites (especially the WTD) and check if both matches each other.
Then we test the methane module and see into detail the methane dynamics component. Any parameters we need to adjust in order to match the observed site level observation?


Now the methodology is fixed. Though a further look at the published papers are required.
[X] Update the inundated area. [Done. Seems like the year 2006-2012 were not finished correctly]
[X] Update the extrapolation method. This must be fixed first! [I believe this method is okay.]
[X] Redo Calibration. [Results look good. Though US-Tw1 does not have the response to the variation of water teble??]
[X] Use the new parameters to redo the calculation! [Since not every sites are validated, I'd better finish those site then redo the calculation.]
[X] Use new parameterization for limiting the methanogenesis within the anaerobic microsites. The same time the Fair condition is also considered in the paramterization.
[X] Three sets of experiments need to be redo. [Need to finish this right away!]

[X] Then write the results and discussion sections in the paper

Need to think about the issue related to the wrong climate forcings. Currently I doubt the incoming solar radiation is low comparing to the CRUNCEP reanalysis, so we shall check this issue once getting time.
Now we have an issue related to the global scale simulation. I found the single site simulation works well but when simulate on a global scale the related single site produce a big negative value which is majorly caused by an abnormally high CH4 ebullition, driven by a verh high CH4 concentration in the deep soil (layer 8 and 9). What could be the possible reason causing this issue?  1) Uninitilized variables? 
2) Shall check all the statements that global simulation differing from the single simulations.

========================== Tasks for the draft revision ==================================
[X] (1) One site is needed to be corrected through a new calibration. I found the issue really is related to the balance check or ebullition of CH4 in the code. Shall revise this and get a smoother emission...
[X] (2) Adding the output of all fluxes components, including production, oxidation, diffusion (can be calculated as a residue), ebullition and aerenchyma transport.
We found the oxidation to be several orders too high in Florida! Any issues happenning there?
We found the oxidation at water table contributed several orders higher oxidation than from other layers. Seems like somthing not correct, either the CH4, O2 concentration, or the oxidation potential. Currently we ignore the oxidation from the water table to correctify this issue.
It seems like the emission to be doubled after ignoring the oxidation at the water table level. So seems like we have no choice but to accept the oxidation? Or actually the production we're using here is a bit too high?
I need to recalibrate for all sites... Just one site may not satisfy our requirement.
Seems like the results cannot be matched until the assimilation rate vmax also being calibrated. This is out of the scope of this study so I actually used a high vmax (80) for US-Myb and US-Tw1 sites while used a low vmax (45) for US-WPT site, as the observed GPP suggested (no GPP fpr US-WPT, 973 gC m-2 yr-1 for US-Myb and 1779 gC m-2 yr-1 for US-Tw1). We need to think much more detail about the assimilation of aquatic plants. Review is required for the further study of this module.
[X] (3) Found an issue related to unsuccessfully writing the restart file. Now checking. Bugs are found relating to the C14 tracers, now fixed.
[X] (4) Other three sites are all needed to be recalibrated. I see Mayberry wetland site to be good after the calibration. How about other two evaluation sites?
    [X] As the first step, now working on adjusting parameters for US-Twt site. It seems like after reducing the oxidation amount at the boundary level of water table we may have a better chance to reduce the parameter controling the production of methane.
    I did not pay attention to the detail of FFSQP. Now it would be very helpful for me to take a look at its algorithm... Well, this is with the lowest priority.
    Checked FFSQP. Nothing helpful for the calibration effort...
[X] (5) Revise the python notebook code to plot both water table depth and CH4 emission on the same figure. Also double check the calculation of Wilmott index. Shall do this first.
(6) Check if the window size 20 is good enough for making figures? How to check?
How to do it and why doing it matters?
Okay, at least for right now we don't tell the reason. Not sure if we need to later.
[X] (7) Need to get the original water table depth obs with positive values when making figures.
[X] (8) Seems like we did not consider the outflux from ebullition. How shall we revise this? Check CLM or LPJ-WhyMe code for reference?
Seems like both model directly adding the ebulllition flux as one of the outflux.
Now we have revised this point, but another problem came out. Since the ebulllition is large but a sudden event comparing to other processes, how to smooth this flux?
The current result seems to me good enough. But our model actually overestimate the emission from the coastal region, which is a bit anti-intuition to me. What kind of solution we may have to resolve this issue?
[X] (9) Something has been double counted. Check the balance...
I found bunch of issues about the balance in the model. Now it seems to be fixed. The diffusion term still needs more consideration.
[X] (10) Smooth the ebullition flux? I found the timing of ebullition to be not correct when comparing to the timing of the observation. Shall think about why?
We used US-Tw1 instead of US-Twt. But we found something not correct that prevent the US-Tw1 to produce a correct order of CH4 emission. Possible reasons could be 1) wrong climate forcing, 2) mismatch of biome type and/or 3) Wrong water table depth. Now we increased the methane production ratio. Shall check into more detail what the actual production look like for the CONUS?
[X] (11) Check why the aerenchyma transport for the first year to be so low?
Checked and fixed the problem related to the uninitialized anpp at the beginning of the simulation when restart.
[X] (12) Shall bear in mind the calculation for dryland and wetland may not correct since we're not considering the fractional water. Shall think about updating the output with the wetland and dryland emission separately.
(13) (Possibly future work.) We actually found the over estimation of the coastal CH4 emission for the CONUS. So my question is what mistakes we may have in the calculation? It seems like the coast region has too high negative diffusion for the dryland (which does not make sense) and too high ebullition for wetland (this point maybe is related to the drastic temperature response of the Q10.). The discussion of these issues are required.

========================== Works for responding to reviewers ==================================
Wetland definitions, then, often include three main components:
1) Wetlands are distinguished by the presence of water, either at the surface or within the root zone.
2) Wetlands often have unique soil conditions that differ from adjacent uplands.
3) Wetlands support biota such as vegetation adapted to the wet conditions (hydropytes) and, conversely, are characterized by an ansence of flooding-intolerant biota.

Three coastal wetland sites (US-Srr, US-EDN, US-StJ) have been tested and we found only the US-StJ (estuarine wetland) could respond correctly since both other sites (mixed salt marsh and ranch) locate at deeper water table regions.
So I plan to use the US-StJ site results for the revision but I did revise the rch4:co2 from 0.6 to 0.3 in order to match the observation. I also need to re-run the case by putting 0.3 for the coastal wetland site.

Cannot find paper discussing these sites, but I have found an abstract discussing the result of US-Srr site:
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.B13A0549S
Abstarct discussing the result of US-StJ site:
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B21L2505L

Need to run another set of simulations to figure out the improvement on the estimations of the whole CONUS.

IMPORTANT: I found some issues related to the calculation of methane emission from R and Python. I applied the same data and the same code but getting different results. This is quite strange and right now I'm following the python code since python results make more sense ... Need to think about why R code produce this strange results.
Okay. I found the bug...

Submitted the revised version. The new calculated results are stored in the jupyter notebook: 
/data/jain1/c/sshu3/SBGC/data/CONUS_CH4/check_tot_coastal_fresh.ipynb
The uploaded data are located in:
/data/jain1/c/sshu3/SBGC/data/GBC_methane

Pushed the github repo on Nov 4th.

Currently 2 stuffs are missing for backing-up the GBC methane paper work:
1). Coastal site level simulations case folders are stored on Cades and it maybe purged. This I have to reproduce it some time.
2). The code geenrate the future wetland extent under the threaten of SLR cannot be found. Since the method is pretty simple I am sure I can simply reproduce the code if necessary.

========================= Second round revision =============================

More sites are added but some of the sites do not contain enough forcings (climate and WTD)
We right now copied the CRU_JRA_v1 2011 data for 2018 and 2013 data for 2019 to aid the sites if they are required.

Site LA-1 may have trouble in meteorology data. Need to perform the simulation then check.

Need to check if the unit of the FCH4 matches the Ameriflux description or not based on the description from the publication? 
It seems like the site observations are correct, thus I would need to check the problem inside the model?
It is not reasonable to get such a low simulation of FCH4, seems like something is not set correctly inside the model?
First need to add the water table depth into each site.

US-Ho1 site run failure. Not sure what happened but once after finishing the first cycle the site simulation will crash.
The problem is related to the wrongly applied water table depth.

CONUS mangrove is 251,293 ha. (Giri, et al., 2016)
CONUS rice is 1,100,000 ha. (USGS report, Portmann et al., 2011 data)
Wetland extent is 470,000 km2 => 47,000,000 ha. (NWD)

===================================================================================
About the reproducibility of the site simulations!

Okay. Now we have made some changes on the calculation of site level methane. Most of the sites we shall use the specific vmax (source code in isam_ch4_paper and their corresponding vmax is listed in the source code) to get the simulation results. To run them, use namelist.cal for old sites or namelist.hist for new sites. To check the output, rename them as the python code requested. If several cycle simulations are performed, get the results of the cycle and then rename them.

Specifically, US-DPW has undergone a change of phenology, which has a separate source code (isam_ch4_paper_usdpw).

For US-Tw1 site, please use US-Tw1_mirror to perform the simulation. We used a different phenology for the 3rd year so the source code (isam_ch4_paper_ustw1 for the first 2 years, and ) and simulation namelists (namelist.cal for the first 2 years, and namelist.cal_3rdyear for the 3rd year) for first two years and the third year are different. After the simulation, coin the 3rd year results with the first 2 years then make the figure.

Also, the python code to make the plots contain the adjustment of ebullition that postpond 2 years. basically, I simply shift the ebullition forward for 2 years. I know this is a very rudimentary  method for accounting the correct timing of ebullition, further works are required to adjust its timing through better parameterization.

The python notebook code for old sites is in Fig3.ipynb, for new sites is in CH4_site_plot.ipynb.
===================================================================================
