\section{Introduction}
To understand soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is important since its high potential on impacting global carbon emission. Currently LSMs are still applying simple models in estimating carbon storage, while the SOC dynamic in northern high latitude is more complicated in physical and geomorphological perspectives. One most important thing currently missed in the model is the feedback on energy and moisture redistribution in soil through the evolving of SOC profile. With linking model estimated SOC content to the SOC profile, the changing profile has a huge potential on impacting energy and water redistribution in the soil which will further stabalize/destabilize the SOC stored in the soil since soil organic carbon content has important impact on inlfuencing soil thermal and hydraulic properties. However, limited works (Koven et al., 2009) have been done on studying this potential feedback.\\
A number of studies have shown decreased soil bulk density and increased water holding capacity, porosity, aggregation and biological activity following the application of farm manures. Soil organic matter is closely related to aggregate stability (Tisdall and Oades, 1982; Elliott, 1986) and soil erodibility (Kay, 2000). Soil bulk density and porosity are functions of soil organic matter, aggregate stability and size distribution, and soil particle density (Mapa, 1995; Baldock and Nelson, 2000). A decrease in organic matter would cause an increase in bulk density and a decrease in porosity, thereby reducing soil infiltration, and water and air storage capacities (Franzluebbers, 2002; Wall and Heiskanen, 2003; Celik, 2005).\\

We note that, although CLM4 does prognostically calculate soil carbon content, for these simulations the simulated soil carbon content is not used to set the thermal and hydrologic soil properties because of an extreme low bias in simulated Arctic soil carbon stocks in the CLM4 soil biogeochemistry model. The low soil carbon bias is likely at least partially due to the lack of a representation in CLM of critical soil processes that govern the accumulation of soil organic material in the cold, moist high-latitude climate regime such as decomposition constraints due to anoxia and the mixing of organic matter into the soil through cryoturbation (Koven et al. 2009).\\

Consequently, the conditions that determine soil carbon cycling are highly depth-dependent and different mechanisms may be operating in different layers within one profile (Rumpel et al., 2002; Salome et al. ? , 2010; Rumpel and Kogel-Knabner, 2011). Therefore, aggregation of properties and processes over the profile, as is currently done in most SOM models (e.g. Parton et al., 1987; Schimel et al., 1994), is likely an oversimplification, inadequate to support new parameterizations of relevant processes.\\

Thus, additional information is required in order to parameterize dynamic SOM profile models. In past studies, 13C and 14C, have been used as tracers to this purpose (Elzein and Balesdent, 1995; Freier et al., 2010; Baisden et al., 2002). Although these isotopes are particularly useful for constraining organic matter turnover times and carbon pathways, their precise information content with respect to the processes involved in SOM profile formation is less clear, since rhizodeposition leads to direct input of 13C and 14C at depth.\\

Fallout radio-isotopes (e.g. 137Cs, 134Cs, 210Pbex, 7Be)\\
Such tracers have two major advantages over carbon isotopes: (i) loss occurs only due to radioactive decay, which is constant and exactly known; and (ii) input occurs only at the soil surface - direct input at depth is negligible.\\
These points imply that the vertical transport rate of such isotopes can be directly inferred from their concentration profile (Kaste et al., 2007; He and Walling, 1997).\\

Use 14C to validate the profile we calculated? (HOW TO?)\\

The 13C/12C and 14C/12C ratios were determined on all samples. The 14C/12C ratios were expressed with respect to the 0.95\% U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) oxalic acid standard and were then normalized for the isotopic fractionation effect with respect to the 13C/12C ratio of the Peedee Belemite standard (PDB).\\

When fresh organic matter is returned to the soil, the radiocarbon is diluted by the older soil C so that the "bomb" enrichment is less marked than in the herbage.\\

In deeper soil horizons, organic material must move down the profile, either by direct physical translocation or by the burrowing of earthworms. It also continues to the diluted as it moves downwards.  If it is considered to be a diffusion process, whether simply physical or due to the activity of earthworms, the movement is a function of the square of the distance and a function of time, and enrichment by diffusion is much less, the greater the depth (Prokhorov, 1975).\\

The change in value with depth (Lower Delta 13C at the top soil) reflects the preferential loss of the lighter isotope, 12C , during animal and microbial metabolism and this pattern is typical of normal well-drained soils (Stout and Rafter, 1978).\\

Parameters: Carbon input (Litter), Decomposition rate (including respiration and leaching), Diffusivity of C through the soil (Bioturbation) and Turnover time (Why we need this?).\\

However the experiments conducted by Jenkinson (1965) with radiocarbon-enriched ryegrass closely simulated the conditions in the field. His experiments showed a rapid exponential loss of C in the field, with some 80\% disappearing either by respiration or leaching in the first year but with the remaining 20\% disappearing at a very much slower rate. In the model this variable is indicated by \lamda.\\
 
O'Brien 1978 used dispersion model to estimate 13C and 14C profile and estimate parameters.\\
Bruun 2007 applied both diffusive and advective terms to model carbon isotope profile. Parameters have been determined by fitting the model to the observations according to the method of least squares by optimizing D and v.\\
Jarvis 2010 applied local and non-local mixing, use both dispersive and advective motions and separate 137Cs into solution and sorbed part in the soil. The dispersion and advection through both water (Leaching) and sorbed soil particles (Bioturbation) have been modeled plus spontaneous radioactive dacay for 137Cs and non-local transfer through egestion of soil animals (mainly earthworm).\\

Globally, soil organic matter (SOM) contains 1500 Pg C to 1 m soil depth (Post et al. 1982) and 2300 Pg C to 3 m depth (Jobbagy and Jackson 2000) -- more than biomass and atmospheric CO2 combined.\\
It has been assumed that SOC changes related to land-use change occur almost entirely in the upper $30 cm$ of soil, because deep SOC is inert on timescales <100 years and is transported slowly downward relative to plant sources (Baisden et al. 2002a; O'Brien and Stout 1978).\\

Our approach is designed to test for and quantify the amount of reactive SOC below $30 cm$ depth (henceforth referred to as deep RSOC) that cannot be considered to have residence times of centuries or millennia, and therefore can be expected to react to global changes.\\

The reasons for these very variable results of parameter values are probably differences in soil type, precipitation regime and faunal activity.\\

Despite the existence previous models discussed in section 1.2.6, there are several distinct gaps in research related to SOM profile modelling:\\
Most SOM profile models were intended to complement measurements in order to explain observed concentration profiles of soil organic carbon, radiocarbon,or other constituents. As such they typically do not account for effects of soil temperature and moisture.\\
None of the SOM profile models represents both the organic layer and the mineral soil profile.\\
Typically all vertical SOM transport is lumped into one transport term, diffusion or advection. Several models do include both formulations but generally no effort is made to relate them to specific processes in the field such as bioturbation and liquid phase transport.\\
Very few of the published studies present thorough assessment of parameter uncertainty and its effect on the reliability of model predictions. Furthermore, the value of different observations to estimate parameters is not discussed.\\

Formation, development, maintenance of such ground patterns and their interaction with vegetation is poorly understood [Walker et al., 2004].\\
We instrumented several nonsorted circles at these sites with sensors that measure soil temperature, moisture content and the maximum frost heave [Walker et al., 2004].\\

The net vertical flux of SOC is thus proportional to the depth gradient of SOC concentrations. Because of this characteristic, mixing?driven net SOC transport has been called diffusive transport [Elzein and Balesdent, 1995]. Whereas this approach is legitimate for understanding the development of SOC profiles that are affected only by net SOC fluxes, it is gross SOC fluxes that reflect the dynamics of SOC mixing. For example, vigorous gross fluxes, when added up, may cancel out such that the resulting net flux becomes negligible. The degree of SOC dynamics by mixing can be thus correctly assessed by considering gross fluxes rather than net fluxes.\\

If net SOC flux was used in determining mixing?driven turnover time, the turnover time would be ~17 years. By considering only gross fluxes, we correctly estimate that SOC is replaced by mixing in the Ap2 horizon in 1.4 ¡À0.8 years.\\

"Ideas".\\
1. What makes soil organic carbon being stabalized? (Large question)\\

2. What are the actual processes happened related to SOC dynamics in order to model it? (Decomposition and movement)\\
(1) Root exudation, microbial activity and priming. (Need to check Kritina's protocal and Foatain's paper?)\\
(2) Bioturbation/Cryoturbation.\\
    Bioturbation: Actually it's an upside and down process. Mainly happened at horizon A and AB where it's more significant than disolved organic carbon flux.\\
    Cryoturbation: Complicated process. Four models have been proposed to describe cryoturbation, and the cryoturbation happened mostly between active layer. The common sense is the cryoturbation has a larger strength for bringing SOC downward comparing to bioturbation. As Charles Koven's method he applied a logrithm decaying curve to describe the cryoturbation strength below the active layer, however whether this looks reasonable or not needed to be examined.\\
    - subquestion 1: Anyway we can represent horizon and its change in the model? The main purpose for doing this is to provide a clue on parameterizing diffusive rate and advective rate seperately since in Horizon A diffusive processes dominated while in Horizon B advective happened. Cryoturbation is an exception.\\

(3) Dissolved Organic Carbon Dynamics and Illuviation/Eluviation of SOC. How it related to the soil water? (Need more literature review)\\

(4) Exoenzymatic activity to convert SOC from polymers to soluble monomers.\\

(5) Stabilization mechanism of SOC in mineral soil.\\
   - Adsorption of dissolved organic carbon on minerals.\\
   - Soil Chelation Mechanism preserving SOC from microbes?\\
   - Soil humic substances have long been comfused to be a macromolecules exist in soil are actually simple bimolecules. This raises the potential destabilization mechanism.\\
   - Mineralogical control on soil organic carbon. Long residence-time carbon pool, mainly minerally-stabilized carbon, determine the accumulation and loss of soil organic carbon storage. (Torn et al., 1997)\\

3. What kind of relationship do plant have on soil forming and transporting? \\

4. About the AGU talk. Water storage change under future impact? How to seperate the contribution of water and temperature to the SOC storgae under future senario?\\

Questions:
1. Temperture impact on soil respiration and soil organic carbon content distribution impacting temperature redistribution.\\
2. Soil moisture impacting soil respiration and vertical mixing through leaching and the redistributed soil organic carbon changed redistribution of soil moisture. \\
3. How the contribution of soil respiration from the deep SOC contribute in non-permafrost region?\\
4. How these interact with future climate? Do we need to seperate the impact of temperature and soil mosture to study it? If we need to do that, how?\\
5. WHat can I get from Umakant except data?\\


********************************
What direction can we go currently to model decomposition on a vertically-resolved based SOM model?\\
Care mostly about all that maybe important to temperature feedback.\\

It will be good to look at seperated organic and mineral horizons. (Yi et al., 2009, GRL)\\
Soil depth can follow the equation 2 from He et al., 2014 paper's supplementary information. Or ask about how to estimate the horizon depth?\\
In different horizons what different kind of mechanisms it will have on impacting the SOC diffusion, advection and decomposition? Estimate something?\\

\section{Materials and Methods}

ISAM is a land surface model applied in several international studies already. Here we extend the soil bigeochemistry part of ISAM model following these several steps: (1) Soil organic carbon model has been seperated into several different layers. (2) Vertical mixing of soil organic matter has been treated through applying convection-diffusion equation. (3) Decomposition is considered at each soil layer. (4) Soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities are linked to soil organic matter density to consider the feedback effect.
Within these midifications, three mechanisms have been highligted here: cryoturbation processes have been seperately modeled through applying a larger number .
Temperature change?
CHanges in hydrology?
thawing of permafrost, and changes in hydrology,

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with the first character following the equal sign on the first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g. \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% For tables and figures, add \usepackage{rotating} to the paper and add the rotating.sty file to the folder.
% AGU prefers the use of {sidewaystable} over {landscapetable} as it causes fewer problems.
