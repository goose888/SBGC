Contiguous United States (CONUS) Wetlands and Non-wetlands Soil Methane Emissions (Download)

This folder conatains three NetCDF datasets:

1. CH4_mean_2001_2010.nc, contains annual mean wetlands and non-wetlands methane fluxes for the CONUS region for 2001 - 2010, including variables (units: gCH4 m-2 year-1):
Aerenchyma_nonwetland: Methane emission through aerenchyma transport for non-wetlands
Aerenchyma_wetland: Methane emission through aerenchyma transport from wetlands
Diffusion_nonwetland: Methane emission/sink through diffusion from non-wetlands
Diffusion_wetland: Methane emission/sink through diffusion from wetlands
Ebullition_nonwetland: Methane emission through ebullition from non-wetlands
Ebullition_wetland: Methane emission through ebullition from wetlands
Emission_nonwetland: Methane emission from non-wetlands
Emission_wetland: Methane emission from wetlands
Oxidation_nonwetland: Methane oxidation from non-wetlands
Oxidation_wetland: Methane oxidation from wetlands
Production_nonwetland: Methane production from non-wetlands
Production_wetland: Methane production from wetlands
Fractional_water: Fractional area of surface water

2. CH4_mean_rcp45_2091_2100.nc, contains annual mean wetlands and non-wetlands methane fluxes for the CONUS region for 2091 - 2100 under RCP4.5 scenario, including the same variables as CH4_mean_2001_2010.nc.

3. CH4_mean_rcp85_2091_2100.nc, contains annual mean wetlands and non-wetlands methane fluxes for the CONUS region for 2091 - 2100 under RCP8.5 scenario, including the same variables as CH4_mean_2001_2010.nc.

Reader can use these data to reproduce the figures 3, 4 and 5 in the main text.
