1. 5 Values needed to plot whisker box plot:
Min, Max, Median, 1st quatile Q1, 3rd quatile Q3

2. How to distinguish outliers?
First get the Median, Q1 and Q3. Second, use 1.5 times Inter-quatile range (IQR, Q3-Q1) away from Q1 or Q3 to set the fence. Data outside this fence can be regarded as outliers.
