plyr: the split-apply-combine paradigm for R.

Description:

     The plyr package is a set of clean and consistent tools that
     implement the split-apply-combine pattern in R. This is an
     extremely common pattern in data analysis: you solve a complex
     problem by breaking it down into small pieces, doing something to
     each piece and then combining the results back together again.

Details:

     The plyr functions are named according to what sort of data
     structure they split up and what sort of data structure they
     return:

     a array

     l list

     d data.frame

     m multiple inputs

     r repeat multiple times

     _ nothing

     So 'ddply' takes a data frame as input and returns a data frame as
     output, and 'l_ply' takes a list as input and returns nothing as
     output.
